# **Pixel Sketch** 

*Pixel Sketch* - is a basic pixel graphics editor, made for fun for "The Odin Project".

It's better to use `<canvas>` tag, but in [Assignment](https://link-url-here.org) you should use `<div>`s as a pixels and make such a canvas from scratch. 

**UPDATE**: Also, you have to use <ins>CSS Grid instead of Flex<ins>, otherwise it will incorrectly calculate pixel sizes and display them outside of the grid.
